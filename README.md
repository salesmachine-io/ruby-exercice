# ruby-exercice

This project is an example of what have to be done when we have to develop a new integration with an external system.

The main goal is to test how you write code (var naming, comments, separation of concerns, reusability, ...) and how you handle new problems.

For each step, it's highly recommended to write rspec tests to validate your code. The first example contains rspec tests, the second not, so you will have to complete it.

So here it starts, the first component to write is a CSV parser which take any kind of CSV file and to extract an array of *contact* hashes. Of course you can CSV parser form ruby std lib.

I wrote the skeleton of a rspec test for this component, you have to complete it.

Feel free to add more csv files samples, and also to add more options on the import method (I only put the CSV file, but you can add headers Y/N or a mapping between CSV column index and contacts values).

The second step is to integrate [Pipedrive](https://www.pipedrive.com/), an external CRM.
To do it, you have to [create an account](https://app.pipedrive.com/) on Pipedrive (they have a trial for one month and you don't need a creadit card ;-)).
Pipedrive provides a [REST API](https://developers.pipedrive.com/v1#methods-Persons) to import contacts, so you can use standard [ruby lib](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.0/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/index.html) to call pipedrive endpoints.

To be more clear, you have to sign up on pipedrive, add some contact manually (or using their API, but this is not the goal of this exercice) and implement PipedriveImporter ruby class which will call pipedrive API and generate contacts hashes similar with the one generated by CSV import.
